This folder contains generated results from the various models. Currently, this folder only contains core model results, specifically:

165 drug model results for 165 LINCS drugs, for combined (1097), and patient subtypes (ER+, HER2, TNEG)

200,000 random model results for gene signatures of lengths {5,10...200}, with 5000 models for each length bin.

Results are included for RSF (non linear) and CPH (linear) approaches.

Please contact pradeep_mangalath@hms.harvard.edu (or pradeep.mangalath@gmail.com) if you are interested in results from CMAP analysis or code to generate plots.
