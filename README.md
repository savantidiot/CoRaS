# CoRaS
Cox proportional hazards and random survival forest methods for identifying drug repurposing candidates to treat breast cancer.

The files listed here contain source code for:
- data pre-processing of TCGA (clinical and genomic) and LINCS drug data
- generation of drug models and random models using cox proportional hazards approach
- generation of drug models and random models using random survival forests approach

The generated performance metrics are available in the generateddata folder

The R scripts can be run from the command line. However, the scripts require files that need to be available in the sourcedata folder.  These files are not uploaded to git because of required permissions.  Please contact pradeep_mangalath@hms.harvard.edu (or pradeep.mangalath@gmail.com if you need access to these files)
